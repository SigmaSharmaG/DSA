# Recursion

This folder contains my implementations of fundamental and commonly asked **recursion-based problems** in C++.
The focus is on understanding recursive thinking, base cases, and breaking problems into smaller subproblems.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

* Basic recursion concepts
* Base case and recursive case design
* Stack behavior in recursion
* Recursive vs iterative approaches

---

## 🧩 Problems Implemented

* Factorial of a number
* Fibonacci sequence
* Sum of digits
* Reverse a number/string
* Power calculation
* Count digits
* Print numbers using recursion

*(Problems are added progressively with increasing difficulty.)*

---

## 🛠 Approach

Each solution follows:

* Clear **base case**
* Logical **recursive call**
* Clean and readable code structure
* Proper comments for understanding flow

---

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis

Time and space complexity are mentioned in each file, with special attention to:

* Recursive call stack space
* Optimization where possible

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Build strong recursion fundamentals
* Prepare for advanced topics like:

  * Backtracking
  * Dynamic Programming
  * Divide and Conquer
* Improve problem-solving mindset for interviews

---

## 💡 Notes

* All solutions are written in **C++**
* Emphasis is on **clarity over clever tricks**
* This folder serves as both **practice and revision material**

---

📚 *Recursion is not about memorizing solutions — it’s about learning how to think in smaller problems.*
